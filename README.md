# Chrome Redirect
Immediate replacement of the Microsoft Edge executable (and wipe it from existence hopefully).

## 📌 Description
This software is intended to replace the `msedge.exe` executable located at:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application
```

Having Google Chrome installed it's a requirement:
https://www.google.com/intl/pt-BR/chrome/

Once replaced, any attempt to open Microsoft Edge (e.g., via Windows system links or `microsoft-edge://` URLs) will instead redirect to Google Chrome, using a decoded and validated URL.

> 🔁 **Important:** It is strongly recommended to **backup the original `msedge.exe`** before replacing it.

## ⚠️ Warning

This tool was created for my **personal use**. It may contain **bugs or vulnerabilities** that have not been fully reviewed. Use it at your own risk.
